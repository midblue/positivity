interview notes
***************

I 1-2'd out of my last tournament
I don't feel any emptions in my everyday life like those of a melee event
specifically losing is such a sharp feeling that it's pretty unparalleled
the best i've ever done is 2-2 in tournament
i almost beat a power ranked player once
1-2, but LAST stock HIGH percent situation
no, I don't feel like I could ever be power ranked
I actually went to summit!
i took 2 stocks off Armada
no yeah I AM just some guy lol
Leffen felt super unapproachable, did you see what he wrote on twitter?
I was mad at Mango at that point for knocking out Chu,
but I did talk to Alex 19 and all of that crew...


michael?
the thing that sucks the worst is losing to someone whose deck sucks
although it has happened later that i found out that there was some amazing combination in there, it just didn't come out in my matches with them
that makes me feel better
