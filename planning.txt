progression
	placing better than or up to par with normal
	beating a long-time demon

"if i couldn't, at least..."
	losing to someone who placed really well at the event
	finding out that your friend did REALLY well

solidarity
	finding out that everyone tends to lose similarly against this person
	finding out that your friends didn't do much better
