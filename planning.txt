interview notes
***************

I 1-2'd out of my last tournament
I don't feel any emptions in my everyday life like those of a melee event
specifically losing is such a sharp feeling that it's pretty unparalleled
the best i've ever done is 2-2 in tournament
i almost beat a power ranked player once
1-2, but LAST stock HIGH percent situation
no, I don't feel like I could ever be power ranked
I actually went to summit!
i took 2 stocks off Armada
no yeah I AM just some guy lol
Leffen felt super unapproachable, did you see what he wrote on twitter?
I was mad at Mango at that point for knocking out Chu,
but I did talk to Alex 19 and all of that crew...


Michael
the thing that sucks the worst is losing to someone whose deck sucks
although it has happened later that i found out that there was some amazing combination in there, it just didn't come out in my matches with them
that makes me feel better


h0p
of course losing sucks.
i need to take a second after I lose out to just catch my breath. whether it's getting food, listening to music, just deep breathing, that time is important.
then, I always write down what I did well and what I did poorly, what was working and what wasn't, etc
so I always keep progressing and getting better
it's ok to lose, but it's important to always take something from it
I'm not really bothered by losses a few hours later.
my friends don't really come out to tournaments.
I've got one friend who saw some melee and said it looked interesting
I don't really have any rivals or anything either
I don't ever think about whether I should beat or lose to someone.
it's important to consider your opponent, but you can't psych yourself out.
